<p>Conventional blood pressure (BP) measurement methods have different drawbacks such as being invasive, cuff-based, or requiring manual operations. 
Sometimes we require continuous measurement of Blood Pressure, which is not possible with our traditional <strong><i>SPHYGMOMANOMETER</i></strong>.</p>
In this project, we are trying to implement a non-invasive method of continuous BP measurement using machine learning models, and later on, we will use extracted features from ECG and PPG signals for the prognosis of various heart-related diseases.
