<p>Conventional blood pressure (BP) measurement methods have different drawbacks such as being invasive, cuff-based, or requiring manual operations. 
Sometimes we require continuous measurement of Blood Pressure, which is not possible with our traditional <strong><i>SPHYGMOMANOMETER</i></strong>.</p>
In this project, we are trying to implement a non-invasive method of continuous BP measurement using machine learning models, and later on, we will use extracted features from ECG and PPG signals for the prognosis of various heart-related diseases.<br>
For the reference, we are following these research papers:

1. Non‑invasive cuff‑less blood pressure estimation using
a hybrid deep learning model(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-020-02667-0">Link</a>).
2. The use of photoplethysmography for assessing hypertension(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0136-7">Link</a>).
