# Heart-Disease-Prediction

<p>Conventional blood pressure (BP) measurement methods have different drawbacks such as being invasive, cuff-based, or requiring manual operations. 
Sometimes we require continuous measurement of Blood Pressure, which is not possible with our traditional <strong><i>SPHYGMOMANOMETER</i></strong>.</p>
In this project, we are trying to implement a non-invasive method of continuous BP measurement using  machine learning models, and later on, we will use extracted features from ECG and PPG signals for the prognosis of various heart related diseases.
